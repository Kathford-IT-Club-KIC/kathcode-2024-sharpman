            <h1>Forest Fire Incidents in Nepal</h1>

            <p><strong>Steady Low Incidents:</strong> From June 2023 to January 2024, the number of forest fires remains
                relatively low and stable, with monthly incidents under 500.</p>

            <p><strong>Gradual Increase:</strong> There is a slight increase in forest fire incidents starting from
                February 2024.</p>

            <p><strong>Sharp Peak:</strong> A dramatic spike occurs in March 2024, with the number of forest fires
                surging to over 3500. This indicates a significant outbreak of forest fires during this month.</p>

            <p><strong>Rapid Decline:</strong> Following the peak in March, the number of forest fires sharply declines
                in April 2024.</p>

            <p><strong>Decrease Towards Baseline:</strong> By May and June 2024, the number of forest fires continues to
                drop, nearing the baseline levels observed in the earlier part of the period.</p>
